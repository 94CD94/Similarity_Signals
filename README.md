# Similarity_Signals


Core to log depth matching is a sensitive procedure which can affect the results of reservoir modelling. It is usually performed by an operator using, among the other data, the similarity between gamma ray measured with wireline tools in the wellbore and the gamma ray measured using laboratory instruments from the core extracted from the bottom of the well. In this context ML can be used to measure the similarity between two gamma ray signals setting a binary classification problem and finding the correct match between the core GR data and the log GR data. Once the ML algorithm will be trained, it can be used to process a large quantity of cores in an advantageous amount of time.
